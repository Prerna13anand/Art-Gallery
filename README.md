# Art Gallery Website ðŸŽ¨

This is a web-based application for an online art gallery built using PHP and MySQL. It allows users to browse artwork, artists to manage their pieces, and an administrator to oversee the platform.

## About The Project

*(**[IMPORTANT]** Replace this paragraph with your own project description. Talk about what problem it solves, what technologies you used, and what you learned. For example:)*

This project was developed to create a digital platform for artists to showcase their work and for art enthusiasts to discover new pieces. The system features separate functionalities for regular users, artists, and an admin. I built this using core PHP for the backend logic, MySQL for the database, and standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front-end. It was a great learning experience in database management and dynamic web development.
